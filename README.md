# Things to remeber

I have slighly changed the card ordering

Cards of Clubs are ranked 1 to 13
Cards of Diamonds are ranked 14 to 26
Cards of Hearts are ranked 27 to 39
Cards of Spades are ranked 39 to 52

Meaning Given the cards 2H KD 10C

10C will be the smallest card
KD will be the middle card and
2H will be the largest card

Also the rank ordering is:
A < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K
